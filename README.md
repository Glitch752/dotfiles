My personal Arch Linux configuration, setup using [aconfmgr](https://github.com/CyberShadow/aconfmgr) and a custom lightweight templating engine written in Python (not because I could make something better than the alternatives, but because I wanted to).

## TODO
- [ ] Add more documentation
- [ ] Organize aconfmgr files
