# 1: Create a muxer between the keyboard and mouse to combine their events
- CMD: mux -c fix_niri_altdrag -c fix_niri_altdrag_out
# 2: Define muxer pipelines:
# - All events go to fix_niri_altdrag
# - dual-function-keys processes the events and sends them to the muxer
# - The muxer outputs to the keyboard and mouse uinput devices
